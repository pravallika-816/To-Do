## 📖 About the App

This web-based To-Do List helps users efficiently manage tasks for any given day. It takes in three inputs:

* **Task Text**: A short description of the task
* **Time**: Time at which the task should be done
* **Date**: Deadline or planned day

The app stores tasks in the browser memory (non-persistent) and provides action buttons to either **mark as completed** or **delete** tasks.

## 🚀 Features

✔ Add new tasks with date & time
✔ Mark tasks as **Done**
✔ **Delete** tasks from the list
✔ Tasks show up dynamically below the form
✔ Responsive and attractive UI
✔ Instant feedback for incomplete inputs
